#Vision Statement

#Motivation
####We are excited to not only improve our coding / web / app-building skills, but also to get our of quaranteen and lockdown and see the world!

#Risks
####Getting all of the appropriate data collected. Coding in languages that we are not super comfortable with like JavaScript

#Mitigation Strategy
####We would like to have some kind of back-up database that users will be able to querry, so that recommendations will still pop up.

#Development Method
####Agile-like development method that will include the use of github to keep track of all of our code. We plane to use the kanban board in our git repository to keep track of and assign tasks. We also plan to have longer sprints/meetings in the beginning and adjust the length if necessary along the way

#Project Tracking Software
####Github will be our main software tracking tool
