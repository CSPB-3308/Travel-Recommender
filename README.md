# Vision Statement
#### Customers will be able to select cities they would like to travel to and learn a plethora of information and recommendations to help plan their trip. Recommendations will include restaurants, top rated attractions, cheapest flights, and upcoming events and entertainment.

# Motivation
#### The team is excited to not only improve our coding / web / app-building skills, but also to get of quarantine mode and enable people to see the world again!

# Risks
#### One major risk that the team may face is finding a workable and efficient way to collect all of the appropriate data, which could include web-scraping or interfacing to other systems. Much of the team does not have much experience with web-scraping for data. Knowledge gaps may also exist within the team in terms of the languages the project will be coded in (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and SQL database implementation. 

# Mitigation Strategy
#### We would like to have some kind of back-up database that users will be able to query, so that recommendations will still pop up in case our primary mechanism that feeds data to the user fails. To address knowledge gaps within the team, those team members who have experience in an area that others may be unfamiliar with, will set aside time to transfer their knowledge to other members of the team, so that everyone can be equally productive in all areas of the project. If all of the team lacks knowledge on a specific topic needed to implement the project, the team will collaboratively research and communicate the information needed to move forward on the project.    

# Development Method
#### The team plans to use an agile-like development method based on the scrum framework. Starting out, the team will begin with 3 week length sprints to line up the end of the sprints with each project milestone due date. Future sprint lengths will be adjusted as the team sees fit. For issue assignment and tracking during each sprint, the team plans to utilize the kanban board available on the GitHub website. The team will hold 2 to 3 standup meetings each week to discuss what each person has done since the last meeting, what they plan on doing until the next meeting, and if they are currently facing any roadblocks. These standup meetings will be held over Discord chat for the time being. After each sprint, the team will hold a sprint review meeting over Zoom to go over the current progress of the project, what improvements should be made to the development process, and plan the next sprint. The team will also meet as necessary to discuss design and implemenation details for features of the travel-recommendor web app as well as demo any new features that have been implemented.

# Project Tracking Software
#### Github will be our main software tracking tool for the project. It will hold our remote repository for the project's source code that all team members will pull and push changes from. We will also utilize Github Project for our Kanban board to track and assign issues.
