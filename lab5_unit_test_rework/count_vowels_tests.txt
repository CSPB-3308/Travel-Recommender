def count_vowels tests:

1. Test that an empty string returns 0. The test will pass an empty string into the count_vowels 
   method and assert that the answer given back is equal to 0. 

2. Test that a string with a single vowel character returns 1. The test will pass a 1 length 
   string that contains a vowel into the count_vowels method and assert that the answer given
   is equal to 1.

3. Test that a nonempty string with no vowels returns 0. The test will pass a string with
   consonants, symbols, numbers, etc. with no vowels and assert that the answer given back
   is equal to 0. 

4. Test that a string with multiple vowels scattered throughout with consonants and other symbols returns the correct 
   number of vowels in the string. The test will pass a string with constonants, symbols, numbers, 
   and multiple vowels scattered throughout the string and assert that the answer give back is equal to the number
   of vowels contained in the string.


5. Test that the function is case insensitive. The test will pass a string with both uppercase and lowercase 
   vowels and assert that the answer given back is equal to the sum of the number of uppercase and lowercase vowels.

6. Test that unprintable characters do not affect the vowel count. Pass in a string with non-printable characters
   such as \b and \a along with vowels. Assert that only the number of vowels in the string is returned.
